# Winter 2016 Contest Problem
## Automated Package Tracking and Analysis
IDT wants to start a valuable package delivery service that will allow our customers to track their packages as they are hand carried to some of the most remote areas of the world. We have already completed the software/hardware to accompany the package that will transmit positional data over time. We are looking to hire a team of developers to come up with a solution for the other side.
## Problem Context
In the world of software development, it is common to be hired by a customer to develop a custom software solution. The customer understands the problem that needs to be solved and the requirements of the solution. Sometimes the biggest challenge of software development is to gain a correct understanding the customer’s vision for the solution. For this contest problem, IDT is the customer and we are hiring your team to develop an automated software solution that fits our vision.
The technical problem this year revolves around automated package tracking and analysis. These days, GPS data is ubiquitous and abundant, but not exactly human discernible. How do the coordinates translate to actual locations on Earth? What does the data stream really tell us? Some information is not explicitly in the data, but can be derived from multiple data points, such as speed or bearing. What sort of things might an observer want to know when tracking a package?
## Problem Description
As mentioned above, IDT is starting a valuable package delivery service and has already developed half of the software/hardware solution needed to track all of the valuable packages. IDT has built custom GPS units for each package that will transmit positional data to our network. IDT has also aggregated all of the data for all of the packages in one place since all of the packages report to the same RESTful web service. We will be giving you our solution so that you can use it to develop the other side.
In an effort to make this contest experience feel like a real software delivery to a customer, we are intentionally giving you a vague problem statement with the expectation that we will work together to arrive at an understanding of our vision. This process will include a week for your team to submit questions to IDT that will help your team define the task, a week to submit software requirements to IDT that will define the scope of the project, and almost two months to develop your software solution.

## Initial questions submitted to IDT

Due Tuesday, December 8th @ 11:59pm

Your team should submit a list of questions to IDT that you would like to ask to get a better understanding of IDT’s vision for the software solution. All questions should be emailed to contest.user@idtus.com by 11:59pm on Tuesday, December 8th. IDT will email private answers back to each team individually. Any questions that your team has after December 8th should be asked on the public forum of the contest website. 

Example question: What do you mean by “a solution for the other side”?
Example answer: Well we haven’t decided yet if a web UI is better than a desktop UI. Do you have any suggestions?
Question critique: Consider offering ideas or examples of things that you could do – help the customer come up with ideas!

## Software requirements submitted to IDT

Due Tuesday, December 15th @ 11:59pm

Your team should submit a list of software requirements that describe what you plan to deliver based on your understanding of the task. Software requirements define how the software should behave and guide testing. All software requirements should be emailed to contest.user@idtus.com by 11:59pm on Tuesday, December 15th. IDT will publically release the final list of requirements after requirements have been collected from all teams (note: the final requirements may differ from the ones that you provide – to bound scope, to allow everyone to finish on time, and to steer everyone toward the same goal). Be careful: if you begin coding your solution before you have received the final requirements from IDT, the final requirements may indicate another direction...

Example requirement: The software solution shall calculate the current distance between the package and the destination.
Requirement critique: Simple, straight to the point and testable.

## Development status submitted to IDT

Due between Monday, January 18th and Friday, January 22nd

During the development process, software companies often keep the customer aware of the progress through status updates. IDT would like you to fill out this development status form during the week of January 18th – January 22nd and email it to contest.user@idtus.com.

Example status update: IDT has provided this completed development status form as an example for what we are expecting in terms of a status update.

## Software solution submitted to GitHub

Due Friday, February 12th @ 11:59pm

This year, final software solutions will ultimately be submitted through GitHub. We encourage your team to set up a GitHub account at the beginning of the project and to use it as a central repository to support collaboration and version control through development. We expect that you will email a link to your GitHub repository to contest.user@idtus.com by 11:59pm on Friday, February 12th as a means of delivery. 
Your final solution can be implemented in any combination of programming languages and technologies that you see fit. IDT highly encourages the use of third-party tools that have appropriate licenses.
Your final solution should include:
All source code and compiled classes of your solution.
Additional libraries and tools that your solution depends on.
Software documentation that will explain how to compile and execute your software.
Product documentation that will explain how the end user should use your solution.
List of software requirements and a single sentence for each requirement stating how your team tested the requirement with your solution.

## Judging Parameters and Criteria
This contest is not only about the solution, but also about the experience of a real software delivery to a customer.
Points will be awarded for:
- Quality and timeliness of questions asked in the first week
- Quality and timeliness of requirements delivered in the second week
- Submitting your development status update on time in mid-January
- Submitting your solution on time in mid-February
- Code correctness and completeness
- Code modularity and usability
- Code maintainability and documentation
- Code performance and scalability
- Code elegance
- User experience surrounding the solution delivery
- Documentation surrounding the solution delivery
- Including information about how to build and execute the solution
- User experience surrounding the solution user interface

## Presentation
The top few submissions will be selected as contest finalist and will be notified by Friday, February 26th. Finalists will be required to prepare a presentation that will be given on Saturday, March 12th, 2016 at the Virginia Tech Research Center in Arlington, VA as a part of the contest awards ceremony. Presentations should be prepared using Microsoft Power Point or a similar presentation medium, and should focus on how the team has addressed the requirements, problem solution, implementation, execution (demonstration), and their delivery. The presentation will factor into each team’s final score, and can be an excellent way to include less technical individuals on a team.
